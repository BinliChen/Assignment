                        <blockquote>Hi,I'm Binli.I'm not good at photography, but I use the camera to 
                    record something inspiring to me and to help me create and draw. Actually, 
                    I like drawing. When I was a kid, I didn't have any friends, my parents 
                    were too busy to spend time with me. So I felt lonely. around that time
                    I received my first birthday gift-colour pens from my parents. they said,
                    "they could be my best friend". Yes, they were right. we became best 
                    friends and always played together. I used them to draw everything I saw. 
                    I felt less alone. after that I discovered painting which made me feel so 
                    happy, relaxed and free. Therefore, I want to be an illustrator, graphic 
                    designer and animator. </blockquote>
