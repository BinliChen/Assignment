         <p  style="line-height: 300%">Hi,I'm Binli.I'm not good at photography, but I use 
                    the camera to record something inspiring to me and to help me create and 
                    draw. Actually, I like drawing. When I was a kid, I didn't have any 
                    friends, my parents were too busy to spend time with me. So I felt 
                    lonely. around that time I received my first birthday gift-colour pens 
                    from my parents. they said, "they could be my best friend". Yes, they were 
                    right. we became best friends and always played together. I used them to 
                    draw everything I saw. I felt less alone. after that I discovered painting 
                    which made me feel so happy, relaxed and free. Therefore, I want to be an 
                    illustrator, graphic designer and animator.
